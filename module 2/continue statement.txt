When the continue statement is encountered, the control immediately goes back to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration, 
skipping any remaining code within the loop for the current iteration.

The loop condition is then re-evaluated, and if it is still true, the loop continues to the next iteration. If the loop condition is false, 
the loop terminates.

This can be useful in situations where you want to skip certain iterations based on a specific condition,
 allowing you to control the flow of the loop more precisely.
