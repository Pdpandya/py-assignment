Negative indexes in Python refer to the ability to access elements in a sequence,
 such as a list, string, or tuple, from the end rather than the beginning. 
In this context, the index -1 represents the last element, -2 represents the second-to-last element, and so on.

 In simpler terms, negative indexes provide a convenient way to navigate sequences in reverse order 
without having to manually calculate the positions from the end. They allow you to access elements starting from the back of the sequence.

Negative indexes are a useful feature for more intuitive and concise code, especially when dealing with elements at the end of a sequence.
