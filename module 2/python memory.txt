Python, memory management is handled by the Python memory manager. Key aspects include:

Private Heap:
Python has a private heap space for object storage.

Allocation:
Dynamic memory allocation is used for Python objects.

Garbage Collection:
Automatic garbage collection reclaims memory from unused objects.

Reference Counting:
Objects track the number of references; memory is freed when count drops to zero.

Cycle Detector:
A cycle detector identifies and collects cyclic references.

Memory Pools:
Memory pools group small objects for improved allocation efficiency.

Optimizations:
Memory manager includes optimizations for better performance.

Profiling Tools:
Tools like sys.getsizeof() aid memory profiling and monitoring.
